    "Base class for compute drivers.\n\n    The interface to this class talks in terms of 'instances' (Amazon EC2 and\n    internal Nova terminology), by which we mean 'running virtual machine'\n    (XenAPI terminology) or domain (Xen or libvirt terminology).\n\n    An instance has an ID, which is the identifier chosen by Nova to represent\n    the instance further up the stack.  This is unfortunately also called a\n    'name' elsewhere.  As far as this layer is concerned, 'instance ID' and\n    'instance name' are synonyms.\n\n    Note that the instance ID or name is not human-readable or\n    customer-controlled -- it's an internal ID chosen by Nova.  At the\n    nova.virt layer, instances do not have human-readable names at all -- such\n    things are only known higher up the stack.\n\n    Most virtualization platforms will also have their own identity schemes,\n    to uniquely identify a VM or domain.  These IDs must stay internal to the\n    platform-specific layer, and never escape the connection interface.  The\n    platform-specific layer is responsible for keeping track of which instance\n    ID maps to which platform-specific ID, and vice versa.\n\n    Some methods here take an instance of nova.compute.service.Instance.  This\n    is the data structure used by nova.compute to store details regarding an\n    instance, and pass them into this layer.  This layer is responsible for\n    translating that generic data structure into terms that are specific to the\n    virtualization platform.\n\n    "
